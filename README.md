Observations about Latitude and Weather Patterns:

Latitude doesn't impact wind speed much.  Wind speeds that exceed 20 mph is uncommon.  Wind speed is caused by air pressure from the uneven heating of the Earth by the sun.  Topography of the land is likely a factor.

Latitude is strongly correlated with the maximum temperature of a city.  The hottest parts of the world are closest to the equator at 0 degrees latitude, and as the latitudes move away from the equator, the lower the max temperature gets.  This is because the sun's rays hit the equator directly, and not at an angle like at higher and lower latitudes, which dissapate the intesity of the sun's rays.

The Northern Hemisphere seems to experience more humidity than the Southern Hemisphere.  That is because it's warmer in the Northern Hemisphere that is caused by a pattern of ocean currents.
